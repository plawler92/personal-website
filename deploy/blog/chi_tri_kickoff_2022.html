            <h1>Chicago Triathlon 2022 Training Kickoff</h1>

<h2>First Training Day</h2>

<p>I consider this the first day of training for this years triathlon. It was the first brick (ride/run) I&rsquo;ve done in awhile and it went pretty well. The morning started with a 37 mile round trip ride to the Chicago Botanic Gardens with a short break in between to enjoy the scenery.</p>

<p>This was the first time I&rsquo;ve spent a significant amount of time riding on clip on aero bars and I could definitely feel that change of position in my legs. Overall I was pretty happy with using them. They felt fast, comfortable (getting the weight off my hands was great), and a lot more stable than I was expecting.</p>

<p>I followed the ride with a 3.3 mile run. Despite intending to run the first 10 or so minutes at a slow 11 min/mile pace I found myself running way to fast at close to 9 min/mile. The plan was to start slow and then hit a 1.47 mile strava segment with some gas since the leaderboards look pretty weak for it. The top of all time ran it in 11:04 (7:30 pace) so I&rsquo;m looking to take that spot eventually. Today&rsquo;s run was meant to get into the top spots somewhere, but after the bike ride and too-fast warm up I felt miserable the whole segment finishing it in 15:49 which put me at 18th place.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>Last year I finished the international distance in 3:40:04 with splits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Swim (1.5km/.93mi): 41:20</li>
<li>Bike (40km/24.85mi): 1:20:15</li>
<li>Run (10km/6.2mi): 1:26:24</li>
</ul>

<p>The swim was very rough and I was cycling through different strokes in panic mode for most of it. The bike section was good as that&rsquo;s where I put most of my energy, but I was hoping to do it at a 19mph pace or faster (I did 18.54). After the first two miles of the run I gassed out hard and alternated walking/running in short bursts the rest of the time. Based on my experience last year my goals for this year are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Front Crawl the entire swim section.</li>
<li>Get above 19mph average for the bike section.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t walk the run / finish the run in an hour.</li>
</ul>
