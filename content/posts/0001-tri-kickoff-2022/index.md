## First Training Day
I consider this the first day of training for this years triathlon. It was the first brick (ride/run) I've done in awhile and it went pretty well. The morning started with a 37 mile round trip ride to the Chicago Botanic Gardens with a short break in between to enjoy the scenery.

This was the first time I've spent a significant amount of time riding on clip on aero bars and I could definitely feel that change of position in my legs. Overall I was pretty happy with using them. They felt fast, comfortable (getting the weight off my hands was great), and a lot more stable than I was expecting.

I followed the ride with a 3.3 mile run. Despite intending to run the first 10 or so minutes at a slow 11 min/mile pace I found myself running way to fast at close to 9 min/mile. The plan was to start slow and then hit a 1.47 mile strava segment with some gas since the leaderboards look pretty weak for it. The top of all time ran it in 11:04 (7:30 pace) so I'm looking to take that spot eventually. Today's run was meant to get into the top spots somewhere, but after the bike ride and too-fast warm up I felt miserable the whole segment finishing it in 15:49 which put me at 18th place.

## Goals
Last year I finished the international distance in 3:40:04 with splits:

- Swim (1.5km/.93mi): 41:20
- Bike (40km/24.85mi): 1:20:15
- Run (10km/6.2mi): 1:26:24

The swim was very rough and I was cycling through different strokes in panic mode for most of it. The bike section was good as that's where I put most of my energy, but I was hoping to do it at a 19mph pace or faster (I did 18.54). After the first two miles of the run I gassed out hard and alternated walking/running in short bursts the rest of the time. Based on my experience last year my goals for this year are:

- Front Crawl the entire swim section.
- Get above 19mph average for the bike section.
- Don't walk the run / finish the run in an hour.
