## Swim 
Square course around 4 buoys in a reservoir. Couple patches of seaweed here and there. Open water swimming still gets my heart racing more than it should given the low amount of effort I put out during it. I got passed by at least 5 people, but I think I may have passed 1-2 which I didn't really expect.

Prior to jumping in I heard two equally disconcerting statements. The first was from a lady behind me going over her thought process for the swim "Just think about swimming and don't think about the snakes.". SNAKES?! About 30 seconds before jumping in someone mentioned the seaweed and the guy next to me I had been talking to told me about how a guy died at the Chicago Triathlon last year from seaweed entangling his leg. Thanks for that, friend. 

## Bike 
Two ~5 mile laps of crushed limestone and gravel. The track was in good condition the first lap, but by the second the rain and number of bikes really took a tool on the trail quality. There were a couple tricky sections that almost caused me to slip (and did cause some others too) including a wooden bridge and the short downhill section with steep turns immediately before and after. I passed a ton of people in this section and didn't get passed by anyone. There was one long (1-2 miles) out-and-back section that I'm pretty sure I saw someone cheat and turn around really early.

## Run
My plan was to run each mile a little faster than the last. First mile was ~9:00 and the second was ~8:40. The third mile completely threw off my game plan. This section was a mountain bike single track course that had been destroyed by the rain. The ground was completely composed of mud and the jump/hills frequently had to be climbed on all fours as my shoes had almost no grip to them. This section of the course was easily the most unique and fun despite it totally throwing me off.
