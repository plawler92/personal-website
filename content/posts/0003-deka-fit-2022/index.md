## Deka Fit Overview
Deka fit is a 5K run separated at 500 meter intervals by a different workout. These are all functional in nature 
as opposed to being weight lifting type workouts. I started the race with a group of 11 others, a mix of both more and less fit looking people. I'm 90% I finished first out of this group. The two other people I know that started strong finished just behind me. My strategy was to treat this mainly as a running race with some other things thrown in rather than workouts with some running in between. I did the workouts as fast as I could without hindering my running pace to much. 
1. 30 Alternating Reverse Lunges w/ 55 Pound Foam Roller.
    - This was slow, lunges are hard.
2. 500 Meter Row.
    - ~2:10 for this which is average I think.
3. 20 Box Jump or Step-Overs.
    - Started off slow but developed a much quicker strategy (staying low, not jumping) as time went on.
4. 25 20 Pound Medicine Ball Sit Up Throws.
    - This was the first really hard one. Took a couple second break about halfway through.
5. 500 Meter Ski Erg.
    - Haven't done this before but it was pretty fun. I was keeping pace with the fit looking person next to me.
6. 100 Meter Farmers Carry with 60 Pound Dumbbells.
    - Sped-walked this part, but had to put the dumbbells down twice to wipe off sweat.
7. 25 Calorie Air Bike
    - Picked one that was poorly setup for me, but still got this done pretty fast (I think).
8. 20 60 Pound Dead Ball Wall Overs.
    - This one really, really sucked. I probably lost some time here.
9. 100 Meter Tank Push/Pull.
    - I could have done this fast, but it was pretty fun.
10. 20 Burpees with 55 Pound Foam Roller.
    - The first 5 felt great and everything after that was a massive struggle. It felt great finishing this one.
